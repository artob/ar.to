Biography
=========

   Who am I? In 1976 I began the debate over maneuver warfare that became a
   central part of the military reform movement of the 1970s and 1980s. The
   U.S. Marine Corps finally adopted maneuver warfare as doctrine in the
   late 1980s and I wrote most of their new tactics manual. In 1989, I
   defined 4GW, 4th Generation warfare--war waged by non-state
   entities--which is what paid us a visit on September 11, 2001. The
   article I co-authored for the Marine Corps Gazette was cited in 2002 by
   al-Qaeda, who declared, "This is our doctrine." My *Maneuver Warfare
   Handbook*, published in 1985, is now used by military academies all over
   the world, and I lecture internationally on military strategy, doctrine
   and tactics.

Quotes
======

   Insurgents know that history is made not by majorities who vote but by
   minorities who fight.

   -- William S. Lind,
      `On War #103: More Election Ju-ju <http://www.dnipogo.org/lind/lind_2_09_05.htm>`__

   War is the province of chance. You cannot predict the outcome of a war
   just by counting up the stuff on either side and seeing who has more.
   Such "metrics" leave out strategy and stratagem, pre-emption and
   trickery, generalship and luck. They leave out John Boyd's all-important
   mental and moral levels.

      `On War #116: The Reality Gap <https://www.lewrockwell.com/2005/05/william-s-lind/the-reality-gap/>`__,

On Modernity
============

   Old Werther gets at the central fact when he writes that "the modern age
   that dawned in the Renaissance is no longer alive--World War II was the
   last gasp of modernity, industrialism and linearity." The death of the
   Modern Age actually comes with World War I; in 1914, the West, which
   created modernity, put a gun to its head and blew its brains out. The
   ninety years since have merely been the thrashing of a corpse. The rise
   of Fourth Generation war, and its triumph over state armed forces in Iraq
   and elsewhere, mark the real beginning of the new century, a century that
   will be defined and dominated not by the West's ghost, nor by the Brave
   New World that is that ghost's final, Hellish spawn, but by people who
   believe.

      `On War #99: The Sorrows of Old Werther <https://www.lewrockwell.com/2005/01/william-s-lind/the-sorrows-of-old-werther/>`__

   To an historian, a crisis over the Senkakus would fit in a larger and not
   comforting pattern: the world before 1914. Then, an unstable European
   order blundered from crisis to crisis, just avoiding a general war in
   each, until some shots fired in Sarajevo brought down the whole house of
   cards and with it Western civilization.

On the 21st Century
===================

   Japan's low-profile, defensive strategy has served her well for more than
   half a century. It is exactly the right strategy for a 4th Generation
   21st century, where survival will depend heavily on staying off other
   people's hit lists.
