    The Tofflers, in their book *War and Anti-War*, state that society has
    been driven by three great waves, each defined by the primary source of
    wealth generation during its era. The way wealth was created largely
    determines how it was distributed and how society was structured.

    -- Thomas X. Hammes, The Sling and the Stone: On War in the 21st Century
