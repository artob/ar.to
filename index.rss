    <title>Dissecting the Unlicense: Software Freedom in Four Clauses and a Link</title>
    <link>http://ar.to/2010/01/dissecting-the-unlicense</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href="http://ar.to/2010/01/set-your-code-free"&gt;previously written&lt;/a&gt; on the motivation that led &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/unlicense"&gt;us&lt;/a&gt; to formulate the &lt;a href="http://unlicense.org/"&gt;Unlicense&lt;/a&gt;, a template for dedicating your software to the &lt;a href="http://me.stpeter.im/essays/publicdomain.html"&gt;public domain&lt;/a&gt;. Today, I will elucidate the rationale for and the provenance of each of the four brief paragraphs (plus footer) that constitute the Unlicense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Unlicense combines a public domain dedication and copyright waiver patterned after those of the well-known public domain &lt;a href="http://www.sqlite.org/"&gt;SQLite&lt;/a&gt; project with the no-warranty statement from the widely-used &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License"&gt;MIT/X11 license&lt;/a&gt;. We also provide a &lt;a href="http://unlicense.org/#unlicensing-contributions"&gt;well-defined process&lt;/a&gt; instructing &lt;a href="http://unlicense.org/#unlicensed-free-software"&gt;Unlicense adopters&lt;/a&gt; on how they can ensure that any third-party contributions remain likewise unencumbered by copyright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire effort and &lt;a href="http://ostatic.com/blog/the-unlicense-a-license-for-no-license"&gt;nascent movement&lt;/a&gt; could not have come about without the inspiration and example of the SQLite project, which &lt;a href="http://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html"&gt;by any measure&lt;/a&gt; is surely to be counted among the most successful public domain software projects of all time. SQLite has combined &lt;a href="http://aleccolocco.blogspot.com/2009/08/sqlite-lesson-in-low-defect-software.html"&gt;technical excellence&lt;/a&gt; with a unique take on &lt;a href="http://www.sqlite.org/different.html#license"&gt;liberal licensing&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source code for SQLite is in the public domain. No claim of copyright
is made on any part of the core source code. [...] This means that
anybody is able to legally do anything they want with the SQLite source
code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other SQL database engines with liberal licenses that allow the
code to be broadly and freely used. But those other engines are still
governed by copyright law. SQLite is different in that copyright law
simply does not apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source code files for other SQL database engines typically begin with
a comment describing your license rights to view and copy that file. The
SQLite source code contains no license since it is not governed by
copyright. Instead of a license, the SQLite source code offers a
blessing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May you do good and not evil&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May you find forgiveness for yourself and forgive others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May you share freely, never taking more than you give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years the SQLite project has needed to develop much of the &lt;a href="http://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html"&gt;legal infrastructure and process&lt;/a&gt; necessary for any large public domain project. This includes e.g. collecting copyright waivers from contributors and issuing &lt;a href="http://www.hwaci.com/cgi-bin/license-step1"&gt;special one-off licenses&lt;/a&gt; to megacorporations with legal departments unable to grok the concept of the public domain. Many a conversation on the project's &lt;a href="http://www.sqlite.org/support.html"&gt;mailing lists&lt;/a&gt; illuminate the legal hurdles they have overcome and provide hoards of valuable information to anyone considering unlicensing their code into the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/unlicense"&gt;We&lt;/a&gt; launched the Unlicense initiative so that any software developer can now draw on this time-tested knowledge base, infrastructure and process to do what SQLite's authors have done: &lt;a href="http://ar.to/2010/01/set-your-code-free"&gt;set their code entirely free&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it is certainly the case that you can perfectly well dedicate your code to the public domain without using the Unlicense, but information on how to do that can be hard to find and apply. Until now everyone who has released their software into the public domain has done so with differing wording, subject to differing legal interpretation in differing jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrasting this situation with the familiarity of simply copying a license file into your source code repository, it is perhaps no great surprise that many who would otherwise have been inclined to release their code into the public domain have instead opted for some very permissive license, avoiding the perceived legal morass of the public domain. This has constituted a barrier to both the production and adoption of public domain software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that the Unlicense can help change this for the better. Think of the Unlicense as a gateway to resurrecting the public domain in software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#167;1 The Executive Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first paragraph of the Unlicense reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In principle, wording such as this is in and of itself sufficient to dedicate a work to the public domain. In practice, given the litigious age we live in and the variations on how the public domain as a concept may be codified and interpreted in different jurisdictions, most authors will want to be somewhat more explicit. Hence the rest of the Unlicense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first paragraph is, hopefully, self-evident in its simplicity; but let us nonetheless briefly examine its constituents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Free" here means most of the definitions of the word in any English dictionary. It means "for free" as in "gratis" and "given or available without cost, payment or charge". It means "freedom" as in "not under the control or in the power of another", implying among other things "not subject to despotic government". It means "free to" as in "free to make use of". And, of course, it means "free from" as in "free from copyright" and "free of" as in "not subject to copyright".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Unencumbered" qualifies and helps establish the aforementioned meanings by stating that your use of the software isn't burdened or weighed down by any restraints or obligations whatsoever; more on this in the next section. Some more loaded alternatives to "unencumbered" would be "unlicensed" or "uncontaminated", which also convey the notion that the software has no strings attached to it; but for the Unlicense text itself we felt it best to stick with the more neutral term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, "the public domain" means those materials, in this case those pieces of software, that nobody claims as an &lt;a href="http://levine.sscnet.ucla.edu/general/intellectual/againstfinal.htm"&gt;intellectual monopoly&lt;/a&gt; and hence are not subject to copyright. These works are available for anyone to use freely for any purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#167;2 The Freedoms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second paragraph of the Unlicense reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or
distribute this software, either in source code form or as a compiled
binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any
means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paragraph originates from &lt;a href="http://www.sqlite.org/"&gt;SQLite's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html"&gt;public domain dedication&lt;/a&gt;, with only "the original SQLite code" changed to "this software".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is simply a listing of some of the specific things you can do with any entirely free public domain software. It is not intended to be exhaustive, merely illustrative. You have &lt;em&gt;complete&lt;/em&gt; freedom to do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; ("for any purpose") you want with the software. When someone dedicates their work to the public domain, they are making a public guarantee that they will not send any copyright cops after you even if they personally dislike the uses you've put their software to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may notice the similarity to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Beatrice_Hall"&gt;old saying&lt;/a&gt; of "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yes, you are perfectly welcome to incorporate the code into proprietary software. Yes, you can relicense the code under any license you please. No, you don't need to include any original copyright statements (there are none) or a copy of the Unlicense. No, you don't &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to give attribution to the original authors -- though as a matter of common courtesy you probably &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be doing so!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legal significance of this Unlicense clause is that even if it so happened that in some backward jurisdiction there were any questions about the interpretation of a public domain dedication like the Unlicense, the authors have here very explicitly granted permission to do just about anything with the software. So, while the Unlicense is not &lt;em&gt;intended&lt;/em&gt; to be, legally speaking, an actual copyright license, but rather merely an explicit form of public domain dedication, the fallback strategy for any public domain-unfriendly jurisdictions is to in fact treat it as if it were an extremely permissive license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to eventually improve this paragraph somewhat, to make it read a bit better and to explicitly mention a few more of the things you are allowed to do. Ultimately, it ought to also be somewhat more, well, poetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#167;3 The Legalese&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third paragraph of the Unlicense reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In jurisdictions that recognize copyright laws, the author or authors
of this software dedicate any and all copyright interest in the
software to the public domain. We make this dedication for the benefit
of the public at large and to the detriment of our heirs and
successors. We intend this dedication to be an overt act of
relinquishment in perpetuity of all present and future rights to this
software under copyright law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This legally significant paragraph is a statement of intent that has its origins in &lt;a href="http://www.sqlite.org/"&gt;SQLite's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html"&gt;public domain dedication&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn is based on the Creative Commons &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/"&gt;public domain certification&lt;/a&gt; with the wording changed (improved, I should say) from the third person to the first person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paragraph is important because it establishes &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;. Regardless of how the public domain as a concept is codified in the laws of a particular country, this paragraph makes it very clear that the authors have explicitly disavowed any and all monopoly privileges granted them by copyright law -- in the full knowledge that this could, in theory, be financially detrimental to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the fitness of this paragraph has been established in the SQLite project, we incorporated it as-is but for two trivial changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We changed "this code" to "this software" to ensure we're covering not just the code per se but everything that constitutes the software, typically the entirety of the source and binary distributions. There is better room for appropriate interpretation in "this software" than in "this code".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also very purposefully added the introductory "in jurisdictions that recognize copyright laws" text. Beyond the immediate practical goal of helping you unlicense your software into the public domain, a secondary goal of the Unlicense is to help disseminate the idea that we perhaps really shouldn't be taking for granted the existence of copyright licensing and copyright laws in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you actually take some time to read about the &lt;a href="http://questioncopyright.org/promise"&gt;history of copyright&lt;/a&gt;, you will discover that most everything you thought you knew about copyright is mistaken. Despite popular myth, copyright did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;, in fact, come about as some noble effort to protect the rights of authors, but rather has its ignoble origin in the privatization of censorship in 16th century England. Its further developments have been by and for the distributors, as is evident even today with the major media companies seeking, and obtaining, what amount to perpetual extensions to their copyright terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this notwithstanding, however, everyone twentysomething and younger knows that we are already well on our way to a &lt;a href="http://levine.sscnet.ucla.edu/general/intellectual/againstfinal.htm"&gt;post-copyright world&lt;/a&gt;. Since we wanted the Unlicense's wording to stand the test of time, we did not bake in the current implicit assumption that copyright is "just the way things are". Rather, we baked in the hope for a future where increasingly fewer jurisdictions cling to their obsolete copyright laws at a clear disadvantage to those freer corners of the world that have already let go of the concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#167;4 The Don't-Sue-Me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth paragraph of the Unlicense reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR
OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE,
ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR
OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This no-warranty clause comes almost verbatim from the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License"&gt;MIT/X11 license&lt;/a&gt;, with the "the authors or copyright holders" changed to read merely "the authors". After all, the whole point of the Unlicense is that there no longer are any copyright holders for the software, only authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it must surely be evident to every reasonable human being that this no-warranty paragraph is, inherently, a redundantly idiotic bunch of all-caps legalese in defense of the perfectly obvious point that "yeah, dumbass, I'll pay you the $0 in damages that the software cost you."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative wording I'm fond of is "assume nothing works, and you may be pleasantly surprised; and when it breaks, you get to keep both pieces."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redundant and idiotic as it may be, we knew we had to include a no-warranty clause of some kind. An often cited, though unwarranted, concern about releasing your software into the public domain is that this could leave you open to damage claims from litigious imbeciles who somehow managed to microwave their cat and burn down the house with the help of your code, whereas using a permissive license with lots of capital letters would magically prevent this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, whether to alleviate a perceived problem or a real one, we felt we did need to very explicitly disclaim any implied warranties as part of the Unlicense public domain dedication. We evaluated the all-caps clauses in various permissive licenses, including the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses"&gt;BSD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license"&gt;ISC&lt;/a&gt; licenses. They all read somewhat differently but hit the same points. In the end we preferred the MIT/X11 license's wording as well as its (relative) brevity, so that's what we incorporated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have preserved the all-caps nature of the paragraph only for the sake of your reading pleasure, namely so that your eyes can gently and quickly glaze over it and continue on their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#167;5 The Link&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The footer of the Unlicense reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information, please refer to &lt;a href="http://unlicense.org/"&gt;http://unlicense.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This final line of the Unlicense simply contains an optional link to the &lt;a href="http://unlicense.org/"&gt;Unlicense.org&lt;/a&gt; website. This is the only "viral" part of the Unlicense, and, naturally, you're perfectly welcome to leave it out from your copy of the Unlicense if you should so choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect that most adopters of the Unlicense will want to retain the link, however. If you care enough to swim against the mainstream in choosing to unlicense your code into the public domain, you will likely care enough to consider the Unlicense an idea worth spreading. But the choice is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concludes my overview of the ingredients that went into the initial version of the Unlicense. If you believe you can improve on any of this, please join the &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/unlicense"&gt;Unlicense mailing list&lt;/a&gt; and let us know how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kudos to &lt;a href="http://bhuga.net/"&gt;Ben Lavender&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.nostate.com/"&gt;Mike Gogulski&lt;/a&gt; for their valuable input on this article.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Set Your Code Free</title>
    <link>http://ar.to/2010/01/set-your-code-free</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is &lt;a href="http://www.publicdomainday.org/"&gt;Public Domain Day&lt;/a&gt;, in honor of which I&amp;#8217;m hereby relicensing (or more properly, &lt;a href="http://unlicense.org/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;unlicensing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) all of &lt;a href="http://github.com/bendiken"&gt;my software&lt;/a&gt; into the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;a href="http://me.stpeter.im/essays/publicdomain.html"&gt;public domain&lt;/a&gt; is these days unfortunately somewhat an obscure concept to many people, and disclaiming copyright interest in open-source software seems at present a relatively rare phenomenon (though there exist some &lt;a href="http://unlicense.org/#public-domain-software"&gt;notable examples&lt;/a&gt;), I will elaborate some on the rationale and implications. As is often the case, there are two kinds of reasons for doing this: the practical and the moral. Let&amp;#8217;s start with some practical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are an open-source developer like me, licensing is likely a growing headache for you. Yes, it&amp;#8217;s all &amp;#8220;open source&amp;#8221;, but which &lt;a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical"&gt;flavor&lt;/a&gt;? Let me ask you: how often have you passed up on utilizing a great software library just because its open source license was not compatible with your own preferred flavor? How many precious hours of your life have you spent deliberating how to license your software or worrying about licensing compatibility with other software? How many wheels have you rewritten because of licensing concerns?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you know, there are basically three camps in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"&gt;FLOSS&lt;/a&gt; movement: viral &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft"&gt;copyleft&lt;/a&gt; licensing (so-called &amp;#8220;Free Software&amp;#8221;), permissive licensing (&amp;#8220;open source&amp;#8221;), and the public domain. It&amp;#8217;s fairly evident that this last camp has been somewhat &lt;a href="http://unlicense.org/#public-domain-software"&gt;underrepresented&lt;/a&gt; in the last decade and more (and there are &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_Literary_and_Artistic_Works"&gt;reasons&lt;/a&gt; for that), with most of the action having taken place in the former two camps. But that could change in an eyeblink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you are like me, you&amp;#8217;ve never cared much for the concept of copyleft to begin with, and have tended to by default prefer more permissive and liberal licenses such as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License"&gt;MIT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses"&gt;BSD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license"&gt;ISC&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License"&gt;Apache License&lt;/a&gt;. That already puts you very near the public domain in practical terms. Basically, the key difference between these permissive licenses and the public domain is that in the latter you stop holding a gun to your users&amp;#8217; heads regarding attribution. More on this later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you&amp;#8217;ve preferred permissive licenses, you probably have often uttered a silent &lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt; when you&amp;#8217;ve come across a nice new piece of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License"&gt;GPL&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License"&gt;LGPL&lt;/a&gt; software whose author has inadvertently doomed it to relative obscurity with his licensing choice. For while you might have extended the software and contributed to the project, your interest level dropped as soon as you saw the licensing terms. It turned out to be the equivalent of contaminated code, and assuming that you are not the only one to feel that way, an unintended consequence of the author&amp;#8217;s licensing choice has been to curtail the pool of early adopters and contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having had that experience often enough, I&amp;#8217;ve so far made sure to stick with the MIT license for all my software (excepting special cases with external constraints, such as with &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/user/26089"&gt;my Drupal modules&lt;/a&gt;). The nice thing about the MIT license and its peers are that they don&amp;#8217;t impede cross-pollination: MIT-licensed code can be directly used without legal problems in other software licensed under an equally-permissive license (e.g. the revised BSD license), and vice versa, because these licenses don&amp;#8217;t attempt to prohibit relicensing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrast this with the GPL/LGPL, which are one-way streets, or put another way, they are an entry without an exit. To paraphrase a classic song, your code can be checked out anytime you like, but it can never leave. It&amp;#8217;s easy to see that if you want your code to be used as widely as possible, copyleft is perhaps not the way to go. But then, that&amp;#8217;s sort of the whole point of copyleft, of course: you can &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; at my code, but if you &lt;em&gt;touch&lt;/em&gt; it in a way I don&amp;#8217;t approve of, I&amp;#8217;ll crucify you with law and impunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads us into some of the moral, and immoral, aspects of claiming a state-created and state-enforced &lt;a href="http://questioncopyright.org/promise"&gt;distribution monopoly&lt;/a&gt; on a piece of software. If you failed Ethics 101 (sociopaths, raise your hand) or are not one to philosophize, you can safely quit reading here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What copyrighting your code really comes down to is this: when you include a license statement in your software project, you are effectively making a threat to the users of your software. You are saying that if they don&amp;#8217;t behave according to whatever arbitrary criteria you&amp;#8217;ve set out in your license statement, you will send some men with guns after them. I don&amp;#8217;t know about you, but I think that&amp;#8217;s a pretty shitty thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applying the coercive machinery of the state in this way always boils down to the threat of physical violence for &lt;a href="http://anarchyinyourhead.com/2009/02/02/the-slave-test/"&gt;non-compliance&lt;/a&gt;. When applied, it &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; fiddles out into &lt;em&gt;merely&lt;/em&gt; financial catastrophe because the victim (that&amp;#8217;d be the so-called &amp;#8220;infringer&amp;#8221;, by the way) doesn&amp;#8217;t put up a fight and does show up in the courtroom to hear the verdict that he is bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat of violence is always in the background, though, and what you&amp;#8217;ve done, if you should ever actually press suit for copyright infringement, is given men with guns a pretext for tearing apart a life, or lives, in case your victim doesn&amp;#8217;t decide to play ball. (The inconvenient fact that you actually don&amp;#8217;t possess any right to delegate the initiation of force in this way is a longer topic best suited for a &lt;a href="http://praxeology.net/anticopyright.htm"&gt;political philosophy&lt;/a&gt; class.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I don&amp;#8217;t know about you, but the &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; effective way to secure my cooperation is to threaten me. That virtually guarantees that I&amp;#8217;ll do the opposite of what you want (even at personal cost to myself), or at the very least that I will choose not to associate with you in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I say that copyleft code is contaminated, I very much mean that. It is code with significant legal strings attached, and when using it you had better be very aware of those strings. Again, of course, that&amp;#8217;s the point of the &lt;a href="http://www.fsf.org/"&gt;FSF&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8217;s strategy, so in case you agree with their missive you will see this as a benefit. I personally don&amp;#8217;t, because I have no interest whatsoever in wreaking havoc on people who want to use my code or (heaven forbid) profit from it. I have better things to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a strange thing, indeed, to think, as copyleft advocates do, that it&amp;#8217;s worth outrage and legal action if somebody incorporates some code of yours into their closed-source proprietary software. In all but the most special of cases, your &amp;#8220;abusers&amp;#8221; have not actually harmed you in any way. In fact, what they have done is paid you a compliment, whether they choose to openly acknowledge it or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, if the code they&amp;#8217;ve incorporated is substantial, they have an economic incentive to cooperate with you by contributing patches and enhancements instead of attempting to maintain their own private fork of your software. Hell, they may even hire you. Whether they do so or not, you have not lost anything, and you may have gained something. This is known as a &lt;a href="http://ar.to/2008/04/zero-sum-delusion"&gt;positive-sum&lt;/a&gt; outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a stranger thing, even, to believe that slapping a licensing statement on your software will in some way prevent such wonderful &amp;#8220;abuse&amp;#8221; in the first place. That is simply a form of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_thinking"&gt;magical thinking&lt;/a&gt;. Those who would benefit from your software without reciprocity will do so in any case, with or without your implied copyright-sanctioned threats; and regarding my software I say, they&amp;#8217;re welcome to knock themselves out. It&amp;#8217;s no loss to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only copyleft advocates but anybody affixing a licensing statement to open-source software is guilty of either magical thinking or of having an intention to follow up on the implied threat. The only thing your license will prevent, or at least curtail, is the adoption of your software. Let us briefly consider a couple of contemporary examples of whether you can successfully attempt to legislate people&amp;#8217;s private behavior, or merely drive it underground with the force of guns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you smoked that joint last night on New Year&amp;#8217;s Eve, did you care about the fact that it is, supposedly, illegal? You knew perfectly well that there exists some bunch of legalese in some legal code you&amp;#8217;ve never seen that claims, if you can believe it, to give certain men with guns the &amp;#8220;legitimate&amp;#8221; authority to prevent you from ingesting certain natural compounds, and to physically restrain and do violence to you in pursuance of that end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, being the reasonable person that you presumably are, you knew all that to be a bunch of &lt;a href="http://www.freedomsphoenix.com/Opinion/062806-2009-12-16-please-enslave-me.htm"&gt;nonsense&lt;/a&gt; and saw right through that claim of legitimacy. Those paragraphs of legal garbage no more bound you last night than do, well, the dead fingers of the dead lawyers who wrote them. Thus, last night you only took the sensible precaution of avoiding those particular men with guns who irrationally worship those dead fingers, just as you exercised caution about walking home through a bad neighborhood and opted for a cab instead. Smart of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To consider an example perhaps closer to home for those in my captive audience who are merely suffering from a vulgar hangover today: if you are anything like most twentysomethings or younger, you will be quite familiar with torrenting the latest television series, movies and music. You know perfectly well that a bunch of lawyers and politicians claim that what you are doing is &amp;#8220;wrong&amp;#8221; and that they would dearly love to &amp;#8220;punish&amp;#8221; you for it every chance they get, and you don&amp;#8217;t believe a word they say. In fact, pirating entertainment is now so mainstream that only 3% of Canadians and (closer to home, for me) 1% of Spaniards &lt;a href="http://torrentfreak.com/piracy-has-become-mainstream-studies-show-090313/"&gt;still believe&lt;/a&gt; that it is criminal behavior, so you&amp;#8217;re in good company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not that this will stop the copyright cops, always on the lookout for imaginary abuses of imaginary property, from &amp;#8220;confiscating evidence&amp;#8221; (otherwise known as home invasion plus property theft) and hauling your sorry behind to a courtroom (otherwise known as abduction) if they come knocking. So be safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practical point being that, if you are twentysomething or younger, you already know that copyright is &lt;a href="http://newteevee.com/2009/01/31/bittorrent-researcher-copyright-will-be-obsolete-by-2010/"&gt;dead&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s a joke, really. The genie is out of the bottle, and refuses to go back in, but all these middlemen are running around in a panic trying to forcibly stuff it back in. Like the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States"&gt;Prohibition&lt;/a&gt; or the so-called &lt;a href="http://reason.com/archives/2009/02/16/reality-intrudes-on-the-drug-w"&gt;War on Drugs&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s one of those things where the writing is clearly on the wall, and it&amp;#8217;s just a matter of time. The world got along fine &lt;a href="http://questioncopyright.org/promise"&gt;before copyright&lt;/a&gt;, and will continue to do so (&lt;a href="http://mises.org/store/Against-Intellectual-Monopoly-P552.aspx"&gt;all the better&lt;/a&gt;, in fact) long after the concept has been given up for the farce that it is. So, why not give it a kick in the behind to speed things along?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moral point being that if you&amp;#8217;re pirating copyrighted material or clicking through idiotic &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_license_agreement#End-user_license_agreement"&gt;EULAs&lt;/a&gt; without reading them, why on earth are you still slapping a copyright notice on software you yourself write and release? Do you know what that makes you? It makes you a hypocrite. Nobody wants to be a hypocrite. I&amp;#8217;ve given up being a hypocrite (about this, anyway) today. What about you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve collected some resources at &lt;a href="http://unlicense.org/"&gt;Unlicense.org&lt;/a&gt; that will help you unlicense your code into the public domain. Be good.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Inflation and the Fall of the Roman Empire</title>
    <link>http://ar.to/2009/08/inflation-and-the-fall-of-the-roman-empire</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;This is a transcript of Prof. Joseph Peden's 50-minute lecture "Inflation and the Fall of the Roman Empire" given at the &lt;a href="http://mises.org/media.aspx?ID=127&amp;amp;action=category"&gt;Seminar on Money and Government&lt;/a&gt; in Houston, Texas on October 27, 1984. The original &lt;a href="http://mises.org/MultiMedia/mp3/MoneyandGovernment84/01_1984_Peden.mp3" title="MoneyandGovernment84/01_1984_Peden.mp3 (18M)"&gt;audio recording&lt;/a&gt; is available courtesy of the &lt;a href="http://mises.org/" title="Ludwig von Mises Institute"&gt;Mises Institute&lt;/a&gt;. I have commissioned this transcript in the hope that you may find it as interesting and educational as I did. Kudos to &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/hadronzoo"&gt;Joshua Griffith&lt;/a&gt; for bringing this talk to my attention.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="00:00" title="@0:00"&gt;Two&lt;/a&gt; centuries ago, in 1776, there were two books published in England, both of which are read avidly today. One of them was Adam Smith's &lt;em&gt;The Wealth of Nations&lt;/em&gt; and the other was Edward Gibbon's &lt;em&gt;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&lt;/em&gt;. Gibbon's multi-volume work is the tale of a state that survived for twelve centuries in the west and for another thousand years in the east, at Constantinople.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="00:36" title="@0:36"&gt;Yet&lt;/a&gt; Gibbon in looking at this phenomenon commented that the wonder was not that the Roman Empire had fallen, but rather that it had lasted so long. And scholars since Gibbon have devoted great deal of energy to examining that problem: how was it that the Roman Empire lasted so long, and did it decline or was it simply transformed into something else? That something else being the European civilization, of which we are the heirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="01:21" title="@1:21"&gt;I've&lt;/a&gt; been asked to speak on the theme of Roman history, particularly the problem of inflation and its impact. My analysis is based on the premise that monetary policy cannot be studied, or understood, in isolation from the overall policies of the state. Monetary, fiscal, military, political and economic issues are all very much intertwined. And the reason they are all so intertwined is, in part, due to the fact that the state, any state, normally seeks to monopolize the supply of money within its own territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="02:09" title="@2:09"&gt;Monetary&lt;/a&gt; policy therefore always serves, even if it serves badly, the perceived needs of the rulers of the state. If it also happens to enhance the prosperity and progress of the masses of the people, that is a secondary benefit; but its first aim is to serve the needs of the rulers, not the ruled. And this point is central, I believe, to an understanding of the course of monetary policy in the late Roman Empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="02:43" title="@2:43"&gt;We&lt;/a&gt; may begin by looking at simply the mentality of the rulers of the Roman Empire, beginning at the end of the 2nd century [A.D.] and looking through to the end of the 3rd century. This period of the 3rd century Roman historians refer to as the Crisis of the Third Century. And the reason is that the problems of the Roman society in that period were so profound, so enormous, that Roman society emerged from the 3rd century very, very different in almost all ways from what it had been in the first and second centuries, a period the historians speak of as the Augustan Principate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="03:35" title="@3:35"&gt;To&lt;/a&gt; look at the mentality of the Roman emperors, we can look just at the advice that the Emperor Septimius Severus gave to his two sons, Caracalla and Geta. This was supposed to be his final words to his heirs. He said, "live in harmony; enrich the troops; ignore everyone else." Now, there is a monetary policy to be marveled at!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="04:09" title="@4:09"&gt;Caracalla&lt;/a&gt; did not adhere to the first part of that; in fact, one of his first acts was to murder his brother. But as for enriching the troops, he took that so seriously to heart that his mother remonstrated with him and urged him to be more moderate and to restrain his increasing military expenditures and his very burdensome new taxes. He responded by saying there was no longer any revenue, just or unjust, to be found. But not to worry, "for as long as we have this," he insisted, pointing to his sword, "we shall not run short of money."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="05:04" title="@5:04"&gt;His&lt;/a&gt; sense of priorities was made more explicit when he remarked, "nobody should have any money but I, so that I may bestow it upon the soldiers." And he was as good as his word: he raised the pay of the soldiers fifty percent, and to achieve this he doubled the inheritance taxes paid by Roman citizens. When this was not sufficient to meet his needs, he admitted almost every inhabitant of the empire to Roman citizenship. What had formerly been a privilege now became simply a means of expanding the tax base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="05:46" title="@5:46"&gt;He&lt;/a&gt; then went further by proceeding to debase the coinage. The basic coinage of the Roman Empire to this time &amp;mdash; we're speaking now about 211 [A.D.] &amp;mdash; was the silver &lt;em&gt;denarius&lt;/em&gt; introduced by Augustus at the end of the 1st century before Christ. Augustus had issued a silver coin, a denarius, that was about 95% silver, and that coin continued for the better part of two centuries as the basic medium of exchange in the empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="06:27" title="@6:27"&gt;By&lt;/a&gt; the time of Trajan in 117, it was only about eighty-five percent silver, down from Augustus' ninety-five percent. By the age of Marcus Aurelius, in 180, it was down to about seventy-five percent silver. In Septimius' time it had dropped to sixty percent, and Caracalla evened it off at fifty-fifty. Caracalla was assassinated in 217 and there then followed an age that historians refer to as the Age of the Barrack Emperors, because throughout the 3rd century all the emperors were soldiers and all of them came to their power by military coups of one sort or another. There were about 26 legitimate emperors in this century and only one of them died a natural death; the rest were either assassinated or died in battle, which will give you some idea of the change since this was totally unprecedented in Roman history &amp;mdash; with two exceptions: Nero, a suicide, and Caligula, assassinated earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="07:52" title="@7:52"&gt;Caracalla&lt;/a&gt; had also debased the gold coinage. Under Augustus this circulated at 45 coins to a pound of gold. Caracalla made it 50 to a pound of gold. Within 20 years after him it was circulating at 72 to the pound of gold, reduced to 60 at the end of the century by Diocletian, only to be raised again to 72 by Constantine. So even the gold coinage was in fact inflated, debased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="08:30" title="@8:30"&gt;But&lt;/a&gt; the real crisis came after Caracalla, between 258 and 275. In a period of intense civil war and foreign invasions, the emperors simply abandoned, for all practical purposes, a silver coinage. By 268 there was only five tenths percent silver in the denarius. And prices in this period rose in most parts of the empire by nearly a thousand percent. The only people who were getting paid in gold were the barbarian troops hired by the emperors. The barbarians were &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; barbarous that they would only accept gold in payment for their services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="09:26" title="@9:26"&gt;The&lt;/a&gt; situation did not change until the accession of Diocletian in the year 284. Shortly after his accession he raised the weight of the gold coinage, the &lt;em&gt;aureus&lt;/em&gt;, to 60 to the pound - this was from a low of 72. But ten years later, he finally abandoned the silvered coinage, which by this time was simply a bronze coin dipped in silver rather quickly. He abandoned that completely and tried to issue a new silver coin which was struck at 96 coins to the pound of silver, called the &lt;em&gt;argenteus&lt;/em&gt;. This argenteus was fixed as equal to fifty of the old denarii, the old coinage. It was designed to respond to the need for higher-tariffed coins in the marketplace, to reflect the inflation. He also issued a new bronze coin tariffed at ten denarii, called the &lt;em&gt;nummus&lt;/em&gt;. But less than a decade later, that silver coin had gone from being tariffed at 50 of the old to now equaling 100 of the old, and the bronze coinage from 10 denarii to 20; in other words, a hundred percent inflation. In other words, despite his efforts Diocletian had not been able to stop the inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="11:07" title="@11:07"&gt;The&lt;/a&gt; next emperor who interfered with the coinage in a meaningful way was to be Constantine, the first Christian emperor of Rome. Constantine in the year 312, which is also the year he issued the Edict of Toleration for Christianity, issued a new gold piece which he called by a new name, the &lt;em&gt;solidus&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; solid gold. This was struck at 72 to the pound, so it was in fact debased over Diocletian's. These were very large issues and historians have puzzled over where he got all the gold; but I think the puzzle is not so much of a real puzzle once you begin to look at the legislation that took place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="11:53" title="@11:53"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; of all, he issued two new taxes: one was taxed on the estates of the senators, and this was rather new because senators generally were free of most taxes on their land. He also issued a tax on the capital of merchants; not their earnings, but their capital. This was to be levied every five years and it was to be paid in gold. He also required that the rents from the imperial estates, which were rented out to tenants, were to be paid only in gold. He took on the bullion reserves of his former partner Licinius who had extracted, by force, bullion from the treasuries of the cities of the Eastern Empire. In other words, any city that had any gold bullion or silver bullion left in its treasury, this was simply requisitioned by Licinius and this passed on now into the hands of Constantine who had gotten rid of Licinius in a civil war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="13:02" title="@13:02"&gt;We're&lt;/a&gt; also told that he stripped the pagan temples of their treasuries. This he did rather late in his reign, still somewhat afraid apparently in the early days of angering the gods of Rome. As his Christianity became more fixed, he felt greater ease at robbing the temples. Now, Constantine's reform in one sense began the reversal of the process: the gold coinage was sufficiently large that it began to take hold and to circulate more freely. The silver coinage failed and, what was worse, at no time in this period did the central government try to control the token coinage. And the result of that was [that] token coinage was being minted not only by the imperial mints, but also by the mints of cities. In other words, if a city couldn't pay its costs, pay its salaries to its employees, it simply struck up some token coinage and issued that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="14:16" title="@14:16"&gt;By&lt;/a&gt; the late 3rd century we also begin to have massive appearance of what numismatists call counterfeits. I would say it would be called credit money today. People need small change, and they simply go and manufacture it &amp;mdash; all of which of course means that the amount of token coinage in circulation is uncontrolled and increasingly massive. Now, one of the things that had happened in the course of this 3rd century inflation was that the government found that when it paid its troops in token coinage, or even in these debased silver coins, prices immediately rose. Every time the silver value of the denarius dropped, prices naturally rose; and the result of this was [that] the government, in order to try to protect its civil servants and its soldiers from the effects of inflation, began to demand payment of taxes in kind and services rather than in coin. They wound up, in effect, in repudiating their own issues, not accepting them for tax collection purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="15:40" title="@15:40"&gt;With&lt;/a&gt; Constantine's reform, this situation changed somewhat and, slowly but surely, the government began to move away from collecting taxes in kind and from paying salaries in kind, and began to substitute paying salaries in gold and collecting taxes in gold. Over the long run, this meant that the gold standard was strengthened and gold remained the real money of the Roman Empire. However, the inflation did not end for the masses of the people. In other words, gold was a hedge against inflation for those who had it, and these were principally the troops and the civil servants. The taxpayers had to buy these gold coins in order to pay their taxes and so, if they were wealthy enough, they could afford to buy these gold coins which were increasingly expensive in terms of token money. If they were poorer they simply couldn't pay the taxes and this meant they lost their lands in one form or another or became delinquents; and we hear constant references to people abandoning their land, disappearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="17:13" title="@17:13"&gt;As&lt;/a&gt; a matter of fact in the 3rd century this was a constant problem in Rome: all sorts of people were trying to escape the increased taxes that the military needed. The army itself [had grown] from the time of Augustus, when they had about a quarter of a million troops, [to where] by the the time of Diocletian they had somewhat over 600,000. So the army itself had doubled in size in the course of this inflationary spiral, and obviously that contributed greatly to the inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="17:52" title="@17:52"&gt;In&lt;/a&gt; addition, the administration of the state had grown enormously. Under Augustus essentially you had the imperial administration at Rome and the governors of different provinces, the secondary level of administration, and then the primary governmental units in the Roman Empire in this time were the cities, the municipalities. By the time of Diocletian this pattern had been broken apart. You had not one emperor but you had, under Diocletian, four emperors. Which meant four imperial courts, four Praetorian Guards, four palaces, four staffs, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="18:39" title="@18:39"&gt;Under&lt;/a&gt; them were four Praetorian prefectures, regional administrative units with their staffs and their budgets. Under these four prefectures, they were then divided into 12 &lt;em&gt;dioceses&lt;/em&gt;, each diocese having its administrative staff and so on. Under the diocesan rulers, the vicars of the diocese, we have the provinces. In Augustus' time there were approximately 20 provinces. Three hundred years later, with no substantial increase in territory, there were over a hundred provinces. They had simply began to divide and subdivide provinces for purposes of maintaining internal military control of these regions. In other words, the cost of policing the Roman state became increasingly enormous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="19:37" title="@19:37"&gt;All&lt;/a&gt; these costs, then, are some of the reasons why the inflation took place; I'll get to others in a moment. To give you some idea of the situation after Constantine's reform of the gold, let me just briefly give you the figures for what it cost in terms of the silver coinage, or token coinage now, the denarius, for a pound of gold. In Diocletian's time, in the year 301, he fixed the price at 50,000 denarii for one pound of gold. Ten years later it had risen to 120,000. In 324, in other words 23 years after it was 50,000, it was now 300,000; and in 337, the year of Constantine's death, a pound of gold brought 20,000,000 denarii. And by the way, just as we are all familiar with the German currency of the [1920s] with the bigger stamp on it, the Roman coinage also has stamps and over-stamps on the metal, indicating multiples of value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="20:58" title="@20:58"&gt;At&lt;/a&gt; one point one of the Roman emperors had a marvelous idea: instead of issuing a single coin he devised a method to handle the inflation. He took brass slugs and put them in a leather pouch and called it a &lt;em&gt;follis&lt;/em&gt;; and people began passing these pouches back and forth as value. I guess it was the Roman equivalent to those baskets of paper we see in the pictures of Germany in the [1920s]. Interestingly enough, within ten years or so after that began, the word follis &amp;mdash; which had meant this bag of coins &amp;mdash; had now drifted to mean one of those slugs. One of those slugs was now the follis; so they couldn't even keep the bags stable, they too were inflated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="21:52" title="@21:52"&gt;Now&lt;/a&gt; one interesting thing with all this inflation, I think it should be a great comfort to us: historians of prices in the Roman Empire have come to the conclusion that despite all of this inflation &amp;mdash; or perhaps we should say, because of all this inflation &amp;mdash; the price of gold, in terms of its purchasing power, remained stable from the first through the fourth century. In other words, gold remained, in terms of its purchasing power, a stable value whereas all this coinage just became increasingly worthless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="22:36" title="@22:36"&gt;What&lt;/a&gt; were the causes of this inflation? First of all, war; the soldiers' pay rose from 225 denarii during the time of Augustus to 300 denarii in the time of Domitian, about a hundred years later. A century after Domitian, in the time of Septimius, it had gone from 300 to 500 denarii; and in the time of Caracalla, about 10 years later, it had gone to 750 denarii. In other words, the cost of the army was also rising in the terms of the coinage; so, as the coinage became more worthless, the cost of the army had to be increased. The advance in the soldier's pay in the rest of the 3rd century and into the 4th century is not known, we don't have figures. And one reason is that the soldiers were increasingly paid in terms of requisitions of supplies and goods in kind. They were literally given food, clothing, shelter and other commodities in lieu of pay - and this applied also to the civil service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="23:53" title="@23:53"&gt;When&lt;/a&gt; one Roman emperor refused to pay a donative on his accession &amp;mdash; this was a bonus given to the soldiers on the accession of the emperor &amp;mdash; he was simply murdered by his troops. The Romans had had this kind of problem even in the days of the Republic: if the soldiers don't get paid they rather resent it. What we find is that the donatives had been given on the accession of a new emperor from the time of Augustus on; then they began to be given in the 3rd century every five years. By the time of Diocletian, donatives were given every year, so that the soldiers' donatives had in fact become part of their basic salary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="24:41" title="24:41"&gt;The&lt;/a&gt; size of the army, I think I indicated already, had increased. Doubled from the time of Augustus to Diocletian, and the size of the civil service I indicated also. Now, all these events strained the fiscal resources of the state beyond its ability to sustain itself, and the debasement and the taxation were both used to keep the ship of state going; frequently by debasing, then by taxation, and then often simply by accusing people of treason and confiscating their estates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="25:24" title="@25:24"&gt;One&lt;/a&gt; of the Christian fathers, Saint Gregory Nazianzus, commented that war is the mother of taxes and I think that's a wonderful thing to keep in mind: war is the mother of taxes. And it's also, of course, the mother of inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="25:45" title="@25:45"&gt;Now&lt;/a&gt;, what were the consequences of inflation? One of the odd things about inflation is, in the Roman Empire, that while the Roman state survived &amp;mdash; the Roman state was not destroyed by inflation &amp;mdash; what was destroyed by inflation was the freedom of the Roman people, and particularly the first victim was their economic freedom. Rome had basically a laissez-faire concept of state/economy relations. Except in emergencies, which were usually related to war, the Roman government generally followed a policy of free trade and minimal restriction on the economic activities of its population. But now under the pressure of this need to pay the troops and under the pressure of inflation, the liberty of the people began to be seriously eroded - and very rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="26:58" title="@26:58"&gt;We&lt;/a&gt; could start with the class known as the &lt;em&gt;decurions&lt;/em&gt;. This was your prosperous, small and middle landowning class who were the dominate elements of the cities of the Roman Empire. They were the class from which were chosen the municipal counsels, the municipal magistrates and officials. Traditionally, they had viewed service in the governments of their towns as an honor and they had responded to this by donating, not merely their time, but their wealth to the betterment of the urban environment: building stadiums and bathhouses and repairing the streets and providing for pure water. These were considered benefactions, it was a kind of philanthropic element and their reward was, of course, public recognition and esteem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="27:53" title="@27:53"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; class, in the mid-3rd century, was assigned a task of collecting the taxes in the municipality that were being assessed by the central government. The central government could no longer collect its taxes effectively, so they made the decurion class collectively responsible for getting revenues and passing them on to the imperial government. The decurions, of course, had as much difficulty as anyone else in doing this, and the returns were, again, frequently inadequate so the government solved that problem by simply passing a law that any taxes that decurions could not collect from others, they would have to pay out of their own pocket. That's known as the incentive method for the tax collect. &lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;[laughter]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="28:49" title="@28:49"&gt;As&lt;/a&gt; you can well imagine, as the crises became greater and the economy was disrupted by civil conflicts and invasions and the effects of inflation, the decurions, strangely enough, no longer wanted to be decurions; and they began to abandon their lands, abandon their cities, and escape to wherever they could find refuge in other larger cities or other provinces. But they were not to be allowed to do that with impunity, and the law was then passed that any decurion discovered somewhere else was to be arrested, bound like a slave and carted back to his hometown where he was restored to his dignity as a decurion. &lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;[laughter]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="29:40" title="@29:40"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; third century is also the period of the persecution of the church, and we find that at least some of the emperors must have had a sense of humor because when they passed a regulation that if a Christian was arrested and found guilty of capital punishment, namely believing in Christ, he was to not be executed but offered the option of becoming a decurion. &lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;[laughter]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="30:12" title="@30:12"&gt;Now&lt;/a&gt;, the merchants and the artisans were traditionally organized into guilds and chambers of commerce and that sort of thing. They now, too, came under government pressure because the government could not obtain enough material for the war machine through regular channels &amp;mdash; people after all don't want all that token coinage &amp;mdash; and so they were now compelled to make deliveries of goods. So that if you had a factory making garments, you now had to deliver so many garments to the government requisitions. If you had ships, you had to carry government goods in your ships. In other words, what we have here is a kind of nationalization of private enterprises, and this nationalization means that the people who risk their money and their talent are compelled to now serve the state whether they like it or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="31:19" title="@31:19"&gt;When&lt;/a&gt; people tried to get out of this they were then, by law, compelled to remain in the occupation that they were in. In other words, you couldn't change your job or your business. This was not sufficient because, after all, death is always a relief from taxes; and so the occupations were now made hereditary. When you died, your son had to take up your business, your trade, your profession. If your father was a shoemaker, you had to be a shoemaker. These started by being restricted to the defense-oriented industries but, of course, gradually it was realized that everything is defense-oriented and the system just developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="32:08" title="@32:08"&gt;The&lt;/a&gt; peasantry, known as the &lt;em&gt;coloni&lt;/em&gt;, these were leaseholders on both imperial and private estates. They, too, formerly a free class were now under the same kinds of pressures that all smallholders were in this situation, and they began to drift away trying to find better opportunities, better leases, better occupations; and so under Diocletian the coloni were now bound to the soil. Anyone who had a lease on a particular piece of land could not give that lease up. More than that, they had to stay on the land and work it. In effect, this is the beginning of what in the Middle Ages is called serfdom, but it actually has its origins here in the late Roman society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="33:02" title="@33:02"&gt;We&lt;/a&gt; know for example from studies of Palestine, particularly in the Rabbinical writings, that in the course of the 3rd and early 4th century the structure of landholding in Palestine changed very dramatically. Palestine in the 2nd century was largely composed of small peasant landholders with very small acreage, perhaps an average of two and a half acres. By the 4th century those small holders had virtually disappeared and been replaced by vast estates controlled by a few large landowners. The peasants working the estates were the same people, but they had in the meantime lost their land to the larger landowners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="33:55" title="@33:55"&gt;In&lt;/a&gt; other words, landholding became a massive kind of agribusiness. In [the] course of this the population of Palestine, still principally Jewish, also changed in that the ownership of land passed from Jews to Gentiles; and the reason for that undoubtedly was that the only people with large amounts of cash who could buy out these smallholders who were in distress were, of course, the government officials. And we hear of them being called &lt;em&gt;potentates&lt;/em&gt;, powerful ones. In effect there is a shift in the distribution of wealth in Palestine; and obviously, from other evidence, similar things were happening in other places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="34:47" title="@34:47"&gt;With&lt;/a&gt; regard to taxes, they naturally increased across the board, but Diocletian decided that it was a very inefficient system that he had inherited; every province more or less had its own system of taxation going back to pre-Roman times, actually. And so he, with his military mind, demanded standardization. And what he did was to have all wealth, which was of course landed wealth, assessed in units of productivity. In other words, every person who had land was either singly, if he was a large landowner, fit into a particular unit, a tax unit called &lt;em&gt;iugum&lt;/em&gt;, and those who were smaller landowners were collectively put into a iugum. This meant that the emperor for the first time had the basis of a national budget, something the Romans never had until Diocletian, and therefore he knew at any given time how many taxable units of wealth there were in any province, and he could simply levy an assessment and expect to get a fixed amount of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="36:05" title="@36:05"&gt;Unfortunately&lt;/a&gt;, this took no account of the fact that in agriculture productivity varies considerably from season to season, and that if an army has passed through your district it may take years to recover. The result is, we hear of massive petitions from whole regions asking the emperor to forgive them their taxes, to remit five years of past dues and so on and so forth; or to reduce the number of units of productivity to reflect the loss of population or the loss of materials. As a matter of fact, when people began to say "it used to be I had five people paying this unit of taxation, but two them have fled and it's only half the land in production," the response of the government was to say, "that doesn't matter, you still have to pay for the land that is now out of production." So, I mean, there's no relationship between taxes and actual productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="37:07" title="@37:07"&gt;How&lt;/a&gt; did people protect themselves from this? Well, first of all, mortgages virtually ceased; long-term mortgages virtually ceased to be given. Long-term loans of any kind disappeared. No one will lend unless they are guaranteed payment in gold or silver bullion. In fact the government itself, under Diocletian and Constantine, refused to accept gold coins in payment of taxes, but insisted instead on gold bullion. So that the coins that you bought in the marketplace had to then be melted down and presented in the form of bullion; and the reason was [that] the government was never sure how adulterated its own gold coinage really was so they insisted on bullion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="37:57" title="@37:57"&gt;Pledges&lt;/a&gt; and securities for crops and for loans were always in either gold, silver or indeed in crops themselves. In Egypt we have a document in which the banks have been refusing to accept coins with the divine image of the emperor; in other words, state issues. The government's reaction to that, of course, was to force the banks to accept the coinage. This led to wholesale corruption in Roman society as the black market became a normal part, as people refused to pass, to exchange, coinage at the officially fixed tariffs but instead coinage was passed on a market principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="38:48" title="@38:48"&gt;There&lt;/a&gt; were, obviously, flight from the land, massive evasion of taxes, people left their jobs, they left their homes, they left their social status. Now, Diocletian's final contribution to this continuing disaster was to issue his famous Edict on Prices [of] 301, a very famous instance of a massive effort by the government to control inflation by price controls. You have to realize that there is a little problem: the Roman Empire was a vast region running from Britain in the west to Iraq, Mesopotamia in the east; from the Rhine and the Danube to the Sahara. It included areas of very sophisticated and very primitive economies, and the result of that was the cost of living varied considerably from province to province. Egypt seems to have had the lowest cost of living, Palestine had a cost of living twice that of Egypt, and [Rome in Italy] had a cost of living twice that of Palestine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="40:14" title="@40:14"&gt;Diocletian&lt;/a&gt; ignored that; he just issued a single standard price for the entire empire. The result was that in Egypt the effects of the Edict probably didn't exist because the price, the maximum price fixed in the Edict, was very rarely reached in Egypt. But it was the people in Rome, of course, [who] had the maximum price lower than the market price. The result of that, of course, was riots in the street, disappearance of goods; the penalty for violating the law was death, a very common penalty in Rome for almost anything; and the mentality of Diocletian comes out, and the cause of [the] maximum price edict comes out in the preface to the law. I'll just quote briefly some of it; when you hear these first words I'd like you to pay attention because you may have a different interpretation of them than Diocletian meant. He says, "if the excesses perpetrated by persons of unlimited and frenzied avarice could be checked," he doesn't mean himself &lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;[laughter]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;, "if the general welfare could endure without harm this riotous license, if these uncontrolled madmen, the unscrupulous, the immoderate, the avaricious, could be persuaded to desist from plundering the wealth of all, then all would be well." Now who are these people? They are the merchants; they are the avaricious greedy types who cause inflation as we all know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="42:02" title="@42:02"&gt;Then&lt;/a&gt; he speaks about himself and his three partners. "[We, the protectors of the] human race," sounds familiar doesn't it &lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;[laughter]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;, "we are agreed that decisive legislation is necessary, so that the long-hoped-for solutions, which mankind itself could not provide..." You know, it's the same stuff &lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;[laughter]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;, we can't do anything ourselves, we need the legislator. "By the remedies provided by our foresight &lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;[laughter]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;, these things may be remedied for the general betterment of all." In fact, as you read through the rest of the thing it becomes clear that the reason the Edict on Prices [was] issued was that the soldiers were the principal victims of the inflation, and that Diocletian was afraid he was losing control of his army. And so the people who are to be protected are the soldiers and the other servants of the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="42:26" title="@42:26"&gt;Now&lt;/a&gt; Diocletian's monetary reforms were tentative steps in the right direction; except for the Edict on Prices which, by the way, simply didn't work and was gradually dropped. But his steps were not radical enough; his inability to create a sufficient supply of gold and silver coinage, combined with his continued reliance on payments in kind for taxes and salaries, and the continued issuance of fiat bronze coinage in endless amounts, failed to make a significant dent in the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="44:05" title="@44:05"&gt;Constantine's&lt;/a&gt; reforms were also partial, but of sufficient vigor and radical character to make a difference. Through his willingness to extract by compulsion the gold reserves of the taxpayers, forcing them to disgorge their bullion, he placed an ever-increasing supply of gold in the hands of the government officials. This was increasingly used to pay military bonuses, salaries for bureaucrats, and even payments for certain public works. Increasingly, then, a two-tier monetary system emerged in which the government, the soldiers and the bureaucrats enjoyed the benefits of a gold standard while the non-governmental portion of the economy continued to struggle with a rapidly-inflating fiat currency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="44:59" title="@44:59"&gt;The&lt;/a&gt; new gold solidus &amp;mdash; circulated widely by its possessors, the government-salaried employees &amp;mdash; sold at various market rates to customers who desperately needed it to pay their taxes. Thus the state had found a way to protect itself and its servants from the unwholesome effects of its own earlier inflationary cycle, while slowly withdrawing itself from the cumbersome and wasteful system of accepting taxes and paying salaries in kind. Meanwhile, the masses suffered from [a] massive injection of fiat money which they had to accept in payment for government requisitions of such gold or silver or other commodities which the government demanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="45:50" title="@45:50"&gt;Now&lt;/a&gt;, we may wish to find some lessons in this tale of [the] monetary policies of the late Roman Empire. The first lesson, I think, must be that if war is the health of the state, as Randolph Bourne said, it is poison to a stable and sound money. The Roman monetary crisis therefore was closely connected with the Roman military problem. Another lesson is that the problems become solvable when a ruler decides that something can be done and must be done. Diocletian and Constantine clearly were willing to act to protect their own ruling-class interest, the military and the civil service. Monetary reforms were necessary to win the support of the troops and the bureaucrats that composed the only real constituency of the Roman state, and the two-tier system was designed to this end. It brought about a stable monetary standard for the ruling group who did not hesitate to secure it at the expense of the mass of the population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="47:17" title="@47:17"&gt;The&lt;/a&gt; Roman state survived. The liberty of the Roman people did not. When freedom became possible in the west in the 5th century, with the barbarian invasions, people took advantage of the possibility of change. The tax burden remained burdensome even after the gold standard was re-established. The peasantry had become totally alienated from the Roman state because it was no longer free. The business community likewise was no longer free, and the middle class of the urban cities was no longer free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="48:07" title="@48:07"&gt;The&lt;/a&gt; economy of the west was perhaps more fatally weakened than that of the east, and when we read in the writings of the early 5th century Christian priest Salvian of Marseille his account of why the Roman state was collapsing in the west &amp;mdash; he was writing from France, Gaul &amp;mdash; Salvian says that the Roman state is collapsing because it deserved collapse; because it had denied the first premise of good government which was justice to the people. And by justice he meant a just system of taxation. Salvian tells us, and I don't think he's exaggerating, that one of the reasons why the Roman state collapsed in the 5th century was that the Roman people, the mass of the population, had but one wish after being captured by the barbarians: that they would never again fall under the rule of the Roman bureaucracy. In other words, the Roman state was the enemy, the barbarians were the liberators. And this undoubtedly was due to the inflation of the 3rd century. While the state had solved the monetary problem for its own constituents, it had failed to solve that monetary problem for the masses and continued to use an oppressive system of taxation in order to fill the coffers of the ruling bureaucrats and military. Thank you. &lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;[applause]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
