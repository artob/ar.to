summary: How to get started with Nerves by building a home security system
  running on a Raspberry Pi.
abstract: Nerves is a framework for crafting bulletproof embedded software
  written in Elixir and deployed onto the rock-solid, nine-nines Erlang/OTP
  platform running directly on top of the Linux kernel.
  I will show how to get started with Nerves with the motivating example of
  a home security system running on a Raspberry Pi. To disarm the security
  system, you need to step in front of the camera and give a big smile.
  In addition to Nerves and Elixir, we will use deep learning with
  TensorFlow for face recognition.
