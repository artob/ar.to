summary:
  My guest appearance on a special episode of the Cypherpunk Bitstream
  podcast regarding the coronavirus pandemic of 2020. (4h27m)
abstract:
  "We got the gang back together: [Smuggler](https://opaque.link),
  [Frank](https://frankbraun.org), and I on a special episode of the
  [Cypherpunk Bitstream](https://taz0.org/bitstream/) podcast, discussing the
  current situation for about 4½ hours (whew!), yet just scratching the surface
  of what will end up being a historic year, in the worst way since World War II.
  <br/><br/>
  We discussed the political reactions to the pandemic and the long-term effects
  on the economy, free speech, mass gatherings, biodefense, cash, infection
  control, and identity."
