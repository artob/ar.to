summary: An examination of some force multipliers to reduce the cognitive
  load of polyglot programming.
abstract: Frontends in JavaScript, backends in Ruby, Elixir, Go, or Java.
  Apps in Dart, Kotlin, and Swift. The right tools for the job at hand, or
  fashions and fads? Few of us are coding in only a single programming
  language any longer. Monoculture is dead and buried. Like it or not, we are
  all polyglot programmers now. However, this trend has come at a huge
  cognitive cost. We will examine some semi-crazy force multipliers to reduce
  that cognitive load, enable network effects to cross languages, and perhaps
  manage to preserve investments in code for years to come in our rapidly
  shifting industry.
