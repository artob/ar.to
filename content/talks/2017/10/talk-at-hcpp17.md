summary: My talk at the Hackers Congress Paralelní Polis 2017 (HCPP17)
  conference.
abstract: We as libertarians often maintain that the state is a fiction,
  sometimes a consensual one. But what if the notion of rights is equally a
  fiction, too? We will examine a realpolitik perspective on how individual
  autonomy was curtailed historically and what a posited rising marginal
  cost of oppression means for the future of liberty.
