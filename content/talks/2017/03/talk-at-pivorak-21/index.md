summary: An introduction to the Nerves embedded framework based on a
  live-action wargame involving drones.
abstract: The killer app for Ruby was Rails. The killer app for Elixir
  isn't (only) the Phoenix web framework, however, but rather the Nerves
  embedded framework that enables the creation of smart, networked, and
  reliable hardware using high-level abstractions. We'll introduce Nerves
  through the motivating example of the development of a live-action wargame
  involving quadcopter drones.
