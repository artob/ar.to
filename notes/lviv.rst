Arto's Notes re: `Lviv <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lviv>`__
**************************************************************

Travel
======

Visa
----

* US and EU citizens don't need to apply for a visa to enter Ukraine. Just
  make sure to pack your passport.

Languages
---------

* The native language is Ukrainian.
  Most people also understand or speak Russian and Polish.

* English is not commonplace overall, but young people and most service
  staff around the center of town usually understand or speak English.

Money
-----

* The local currency is `hryvnia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_hryvnia>`__
  (sign ₴, code UAH). Exchange rate rules-of-thumb as of September 2017 are
  30:1 UAH/EUR and 25:1 UAH/USD.

* UAH currency is generally not accepted by money exchangers outside Ukraine.
  Prepare to use ATMs or exchangers to get cash upon arrival (or at the Kiev
  airport), and to exchange any surplus UAH cash back to your own currency
  prior to departing Ukraine.

* The airport has several ATMs, and it's not difficult to locate ATMs around
  town.

* Getting cash from random ATMs can be problematic. Withdrawal limits of
  ₴500 to ₴2,000 are typical. Withdrawals are also frequently rejected for
  no discernible reason; prepare accordingly.

* The only reliable ATMs are those of PrivatBank, where you can withdraw up
  to ₴8,000 in cash at a time, though the 4% commission (up to ₴320 at a
  time) is a joykill.

* If the ATMs at ProCredit Bank (Shevchenka Ave 28) work with your card, you
  may be able to withdraw up to ₴8,000 at a time without a commission.

* To ensure having enough cash, a prudent option is to bring some foreign
  currencies of interest (EUR, PLN, USD) and then exchange the notes at
  exchangers or banks at the airport or throughout the center of town.
  Exchange rates are clearly posted and the spread is usually reasonable.

* Plastic payment methods (Visa, MasterCard, etc) are accepted in most
  points of sale, including hotels, supermarkets, cafes, and restaurants.

Services
========

Taxi
----

* Hopping into a random taxi without being able to speak Ukrainian or
  Russian almost invariably means getting the tourist special, which entails
  2-3x the ordinary fare.

* Few taxi drivers speak English. Recommend agreeing the fare and
  destination beforehand using Google Translate.

* Taxis generally only accept cash; foreign currencies of interest (EUR,
  PLN, USD) are usually negotiable, though the exchange rate won't be in
  your favor.

* Taxis don't often have seatbelts. (And most people don't generally use
  seatbelts in cars.) If you need seatbelts, check for them before stepping
  into a taxi, or just use Uber.

* Use Uber if possible for a better experience than taxis and cheaper than
  the taxi tourist special (though not cheaper than the ordinary fare of
  taxis). There are up to 1,000 Uber drivers in town and most trips cost
  about ₴50-200 (€2-6). You don't need to speak with the driver beyond a
  basic polite greeting and farewell.

* Other taxi apps include: `Uklon <http://www.uklon.com.ua/>`__

* You can also call `ELC Taxi <http://www.elc.com.ua/>`__ or +380-952600486

Supermarkets
------------

* The two major supermarket chains are Silpo (Сільпо) and Arsen (Арсен).

* The best supermarkets can be found at major shopping malls such as King
  Cross Leopolis and Victoria Gardens.

* In the center of town, there is a 24/7 Arsen supermarket on the bottom
  floor of the Roksolana shopping mall on Soborna Square. It's small,
  congested, and claustrophobic, but the best option in walking distance.
  There are also 24/7 kiosks and convenience stores.
