Arto's Notes re: projects
*************************

I work on `autonomous drone swarm wargames <http://conreality.org/>`__.

In my copious free time, I study `military theory & history
</notes/warfare>`__ and prognosticate on the impact of emerging
technologies of mass superempowerment.

See my `GitHub <https://github.com/bendiken>`__ and `Open Hub
<https://www.openhub.net/accounts/bendiken>`__ profiles for the full list of
open-source projects that I currently participate in.
