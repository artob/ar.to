Arto's Notes re: John Boyd

Levels of War
=============

   To the traditional levels of war--tactical, operational, and
   strategic--Boyd added three new ones: physical, mental, and moral. It is
   useful to think of these as forming a nine-box grid, with tactical,
   operational, and strategic on one axis and physical, mental, and moral on
   the other. Our armed forces focus on the single box defined by tactical
   and physical, where we are vastly superior. But non-state forces focus on
   the strategic and the moral, where they are often stronger, in part
   because they represent David confronting Goliath. In war, a higher level
   trumps a lower, so our repeated victories at the tactical, physical level
   are negated by our enemiesâ€™ successes on the strategic and moral levels,
   and we lose.

Significance
============

   Col. John Boyd, USAF, was undoubtedly the greatest military theorist
   America has produced.

   Boyd was the greatest military theoretician since Sun Tzu.

Parallels
=========

   [Chet] Richards [thinks] Boyd is the most recent link in a chain that
   began with Sun Tzu and continued with Musashi, the sixteenth-century
   samurai, and then with Mao Tse Tung. Richards says the similarities
   between Musashi and Boyd are many: Boyd's shiny fighter aircraft was like
   the lacquered armor of a samurai. Both went into battle one-on-one. Both
   had personal habits that caused others to think them uncouth. Both lived
   by an austere code of honor and self-sacrifice. Both believed that if
   they confused an enemy before the battle, they had won even before the
   fight. In combat, neither ever lost a battle. Both read widely and were
   single-minded in their search for enlightenment. Both loomed large in
   their times. Both evolved from fighters into teachers and both left works
   that lived long after their death. Musashi's famous work was *A Book of
   Five Rings* and Boyd's was the OODA Loop. The OODA Loop is in five pieces,
   the "Loop" itself being the fifth.
