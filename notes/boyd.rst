Levels of War
=============

   To the traditional levels of war--tactical, operational, and
   strategic--Boyd added three new ones: physical, mental, and moral. It is
   useful to think of these as forming a nine-box grid, with tactical,
   operational, and strategic on one axis and physical, mental, and moral on
   the other. Our armed forces focus on the single box defined by tactical
   and physical, where we are vastly superior. But non-state forces focus on
   the strategic and the moral, where they are often stronger, in part
   because they represent David confronting Goliath. In war, a higher level
   trumps a lower, so our repeated victories at the tactical, physical level
   are negated by our enemiesâ€™ successes on the strategic and moral levels,
   and we lose.
