Arto's Notes re: John Boyd
**************************

Significance
============

   Col. John Boyd, USAF, was undoubtedly the greatest military theorist
   America has produced.

   Boyd was the greatest military theoretician since Sun Tzu.

Levels of War
=============

   To the traditional levels of war--tactical, operational, and
   strategic--Boyd added three new ones: physical, mental, and moral. It is
   useful to think of these as forming a nine-box grid, with tactical,
   operational, and strategic on one axis and physical, mental, and moral on
   the other. Our armed forces focus on the single box defined by tactical
   and physical, where we are vastly superior. But non-state forces focus on
   the strategic and the moral, where they are often stronger, in part
   because they represent David confronting Goliath. In war, a higher level
   trumps a lower, so our repeated victories at the tactical, physical level
   are negated by our enemiesâ€™ successes on the strategic and moral levels,
   and we lose.

   War is the province of chance. You cannot predict the outcome of a war
   just by counting up the stuff on either side and seeing who has more.
   Such "metrics" leave out strategy and stratagem, pre-emption and
   trickery, generalship and luck. They leave out John Boyd's all-important
   mental and moral levels.

The Moral Level of War
----------------------

   Fourth Generation war focuses on the moral level, where it works to
   convince all parties, neutrals as well as belligerents, that the cause
   for which a Fourth Generation entity is fighting is morally superior. It
   turns its state enemies inward against themselves on the moral level,
   making the political calculations of the mental level irrelevant.

      `On War #90: The Sling and The Stone <https://www.lewrockwell.com/2004/11/william-s-lind/the-sling-and-the-stone/>`__

   Even in these most favorable conditions it was only after great difficulty
   and enormous losses that we were finally able to win. A victory at such a
   cost was actually a moral defeat... Our people never knew [in 1940] that
   we had suffered a moral defeat, because they were never told the truth,
   Quite the contrary. When the Finnish war ended our country was told, "Let
   the trumpets of victory sound!" But the seeds of doubt had been sown.

   -- Nikita Khrushchev, Memoirs; quoted in
      `A Thousand Lakes of Red Blood on White Snow <http://ar.to/2010/08/red-blood-white-snow>`__

   Boyd said that the greatest weakness a person or a nation can have at the
   highest level of war, the moral level, is a contradiction between what they
   say and what they do. From that I think follows the basic definition of
   psyops in Fourth Generation war: psyops are not what you say but what you
   do. [...]

   Washington and the CPA seem to define "liberation" as beating the Iraqis
   to a pulp, then handing them their "freedom" like a gift from a master to
   a slave. In societies where honor, dignity and manliness are still
   important virtues, that can never work.

   -- `William S. Lind <lind>`__,
      `On War #69: Psyops In Fourth Generation War <http://www.dnipogo.org/lind/lind_5_25_04.htm>`__

   From al-Sadr's perspective, the fact that he suffered an (inevitable)
   tactical defeat at the hands of the Americans is far less important than
   the fact he fought the Americans. Iraq and the world saw the same show
   they witnessed before America "returned sovereignty to Iraq," namely
   Iraqis armed only with AK-47s and RPGs fighting American tanks and
   aircraft. As always, when David fights Goliath, David wins, at least on
   the moral level.

      `On War #81: The Desert Fox <https://www.lewrockwell.com/2004/08/william-s-lind/the-desert-fox/>`__

   The central dilemma in Fourth Generation war, that what wins at the
   physical level tends to lead to defeat at the moral level. Goliath may
   mop the floor with his smaller, weaker opponents, but in doing so he
   makes himself universally hated.

      `On War #84: Learning Curve <https://www.lewrockwell.com/2004/09/william-s-lind/learning-curves/>`__

   We continue to bomb and shell Fallujah, which pushes our enemies toward
   each other. We seem to be readying an all-out assault on the city, which
   will have the usual result when Goliath defeats David: a moral defeat for
   Goliath. Many Iraqis will die, the city will be wrecked (as always, we will
   promise to rebuild it but not do so), and any losses the insurgents suffer
   will be made up many times over by a flood of new recruits. Never was it
   more truly said that, "We have met the enemy, and he is us."

   -- `William S. Lind <lind>`__,
      `On War #88: Fallujah and The Moral Level Of War <http://www.dnipogo.org/lind/lind_10_21_04.htm>`__

   What "wins" at the tactical and physical levels may lose at the
   operational, strategic, mental and moral levels, where 4GW is decided.
   Martin van Creveld argues that one reason the British have not lost in
   Northern Ireland is that the British Army has taken more casualties than
   it has inflicted. This is something the Second Generation American
   military has great trouble grasping, because it defines success in terms
   of comparative attrition rates.

   -- `William S. Lind <lind>`__,
      `On War #90: The Sling and The Stone <https://www.lewrockwell.com/2004/11/william-s-lind/the-sling-and-the-stone/>`__

   Here we see in dramatic fashion America's loss of the "Global War on
   Terrorism" at the moral level. By invading and occupying Iraq, a country
   that posed no threat to us, and threatening to do the same to other
   countries around the world, we have made America into a monster--even in
   Turkey, the country that has been our closest Islamic ally since the
   onset of the Cold War. So dramatically has America managed to reverse its
   post-9/11 moral ascendancy that not only can Turks imagine us attacking
   Turkey, they see Russia coming to their rescue! Russia has been Turkey's
   number one enemy for centuries.

   -- `William S. Lind <lind>`__,
      `On War #106: Turkish Delight <http://www.dnipogo.org/lind/lind_3_01_05.htm>`__

   I suspect that more than a few of our soldiers and Marines in Iraq and
   Afghanistan, enjoying as they do a daily diet of IEDs, ambushes and
   mortarings, were less than amused at watching Washington flee from a
   flea. More importantly, what message does such easy panic send to the
   rest of the world? Osama bin Laden has whole armies trying to kill him,
   but as best I know he has shown no signs of fear. Here again we see the
   power of the moral level of war. In cultures less decadent than our own,
   few men are likely to identify with leaders who fill their pants at one
   tiny blip on a radar screen.

      `On War #118: Of Cabbages and Kings <https://www.lewrockwell.com/2005/05/william-s-lind/of-cabbages-and-kings/>`__

   The fact is, both sides don't get to operate by the same rules in 4GW.
   While the very strength of the intervening power means it must be careful
   how it applies its strength, that is much less true of the weaker forces
   opposing it. This is an aspect of what Martin van Creveld calls the power
   of weakness. Viewed from the moral level, a weak force can get away with
   tactics that damn its vastly stronger enemy. Its weakness itself tends to
   justify whatever it does.

   Suicide bombing is itself a tactic of the weak (which does not mean it is
   ineffective). The United States bombs from aircraft, where the pilot
   operates in complete safety against 4GW opponents, with rare exceptions.
   At the moral level, that safety works against us, not for us. In
   contrast, the fact that 4GW fighters often have to give their lives to
   place their bombs works for them. Their combination of physical weakness
   and apparent heroism leads civilians from their own culture to excuse
   them much, including "collateral damage" they would never excuse if the
   bomb came from an American F-18.

   -- `William S. Lind <lind>`__,
      `On War #141: It Ain't Fair <http://www.dnipogo.org/lind/lind_11_30_05.htm>`__

   What Fourth Generation opponents actually do to a state is not play
   mind-games with the state's leaders, but use the power of weakness to
   bring the opposing state's whole population to regard the war as an
   abomination. Paradoxically, the more the state is successful in winning
   on the battlefield by turning its immense, hi-tech firepower on guys in
   bathrobes who are armed only with rusty World War II rifles, the more it
   becomes disgusted with itself. The weaker the Fourth Generation enemy is
   physically, the stronger he is morally. And the moral level is decisive.

   -- `William S. Lind <lind>`__,
      `On War #147: Critics of the Fourth Generation: the Good, the Bad and the Ugly <http://www.dnipogo.org/lind/lind_1_10_06.htm>`__

   Mistreatment of civilians by the forces of an occupying power are a
   central element of Fourth Generation war. They are one of the main
   reasons why occupiers tend to lose [...]

   Every firefight we win in Iraq or Afghanistan does little for our pride,
   because we are so much stronger than the people we are defeating. Every
   time we get hit successfully by a weaker enemy, we feel like chumps, and
   cannot look ourselves in the mirror (again, with IED attacks this happens
   quite often). Whenever we use our superior strength against Iraqi
   civilians, which is to say every time we drive down an Iraqi street, we
   diminish ourselves in our own eyes. Eventually, we come to look at
   ourselves with contempt and see ourselves as monsters. One way to justify
   being a monster is to behave like one, which makes the problem worse
   still. The resulting downward spiral, which every army in this kind of
   war has gotten caught in, leads to indiscipline, demoralization, and
   disintegration of larger units as fire teams and squads simply go feral.

      `On War #169: The Power of Weakness, Again <http://www.dnipogo.org/lind/lind_6_07_06.htm>`__

   There is no surer or faster way to lose in 4GW than by calling in
   airstrikes. It is a disaster on every level. Physically, it inevitably
   kills far more civilians than enemies, enraging the population against us
   and driving them into the arms of our opponents. Mentally, it tells the
   insurgents we are cowards who only dare fight them from 20,000 feet in
   the air. Morally, it turns us into Goliath, a monster every real man has
   to fight. So negative are the results of air strikes in this kind of war
   that there is only one possible good number of them: zero (unless we are
   employing the "Hama model," which we are not).

The Mental Level of War
-----------------------

   At the mental level, there were a few mentions of PSYOPS, but even these
   were misconceived as what we say. Real PSYOPS are what we do, like
   stepping on the heads of detainees. Only one briefing grasped this
   essential point.

   -- `William S. Lind <lind>`__,
      `On War #84: Learning Curve <https://www.lewrockwell.com/2004/09/william-s-lind/learning-curves/>`__

   At the mental level, the Fourth Generation elements have already gotten
   inside the heads of Iraqi police and National Guardsmen. How? By killing
   them in large numbers. More than 700 have died in the past year [2003],
   with many more wounded. A story on four recruits for the Iraqi police in
   the September 27 Washington Post quotes one of them as saying, "We're
   walking dead men."

   That fear opens the door to the sort of deal that typifies Arab
   countries: the police and Guardsmen collect their paychecks, but look the
   other way when the resistance is up to something. In some cases, the deal
   can go further and create double agents, men inside the security forces
   who actually work for one or more of the resistance organizations. [...]

   At the moral level, the position of the Iraqi police and Guardsmen is
   almost hopeless. They are being paid to fight their own countrymen and
   fellow Mohammedans on behalf of an occupying foreign power that is also
   (nominally) Christian.

Boyd Cycle (aka the OODA Loop)
==============================

Parallels
=========

   [Chet] Richards [thinks] Boyd is the most recent link in a chain that
   began with Sun Tzu and continued with Musashi, the sixteenth-century
   samurai, and then with Mao Tse Tung. Richards says the similarities
   between Musashi and Boyd are many: Boyd's shiny fighter aircraft was like
   the lacquered armor of a samurai. Both went into battle one-on-one. Both
   had personal habits that caused others to think them uncouth. Both lived
   by an austere code of honor and self-sacrifice. Both believed that if
   they confused an enemy before the battle, they had won even before the
   fight. In combat, neither ever lost a battle. Both read widely and were
   single-minded in their search for enlightenment. Both loomed large in
   their times. Both evolved from fighters into teachers and both left works
   that lived long after their death. Musashi's famous work was *A Book of
   Five Rings* and Boyd's was the OODA Loop. The OODA Loop is in five pieces,
   the "Loop" itself being the fifth.
