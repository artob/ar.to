Current Inventory
-----------------

*Note: looking to unload these two FPGA starter development boards, as I've
outgrown their capabilities and will need rather more advanced boards going
forward. Their condition is "as new". Available for pick up in Friedrichshain
on a pay-what-you-will basis; email me at arto@bendiken.net for logistics.*
