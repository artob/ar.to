`Dependent Types <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type>`__
------------------------------------------------------------------

   "Dependent types are useful not only because they help you express
   correctness properties in types. Dependent types also often let you write
   certified programs without writing anything that looks like a proof. Even
   with subset types, which for many contexts can be used to express any
   relevant property with enough acrobatics, the human driving the proof
   assistant usually has to build some proofs explicitly. Writing formal
   proofs is hard, so we want to avoid it as far as possible. Dependent
   types are invaluable for this purpose."
