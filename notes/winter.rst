1. Base Layer
-------------

The underwear base layer against the skin provides the first layer of
insulation and most importantly manages moisture removal, pulling sweat away
from the skin.

2. Insulating Layer
-------------------

The middle insulating layer protects you from the cold by trapping in heat.

For extreme environments, you can wear more than one insulating layer.
