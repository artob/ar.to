Safety
------

`Jeff Cooper's four basic rules of gun safety`__:

1. **All guns are always loaded.**
   Even if they are not, treat them as if they are.
2. **Never let the muzzle cover anything you are not willing to destroy.**
   (For those who insist that this particular gun is unloaded, see *Rule #1*.)
3. **Keep your finger off the trigger till your sights are on the target.**
   This is the *Golden Rule*. Its violation is directly responsible for
   about 60 percent of inadvertent discharges.
4. **Identify your target, and what is behind it.**
   Never shoot at anything that you have not positively identified.
