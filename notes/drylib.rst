Concept
=======

The polyglot programmer's standard library.

Rationale
=========

* Reduces the cognitive load of frequently switching between different
  programming languages.

* Enables network effects to cross different languages.

* Facilitates code generation for multiple target languages.

Languages
=========

Primary target languages:

* `C++ <https://github.com/dryproject/drylib.cpp>`__ (for systems programming)
* `Dart <https://github.com/dryproject/drylib.dart>`__ (for `Flutter <flutter>`__ apps)
* `Go <https://github.com/dryproject/drylib.go>`__ (for `CLI <cli>`__ tooling)
* `Lua <https://github.com/dryproject/drylib.lua>`__ (for embeddable scripting)
* `OCaml <https://github.com/dryproject/drylib.ocaml>`__ (for `compiler development <drylang>`__)

Secondary target languages:

* `C <https://github.com/dryproject/drylib.c>`__ (for `code generation <codegen>`__)
* `Python <https://github.com/dryproject/drylib.py>`__ (for general scripting)

Tertiary target languages:

* `Common Lisp <https://github.com/dryproject/drylib.lisp>`__
* `D <https://github.com/dryproject/drylib.d>`__ (for systems programming)
* `Julia <https://github.com/dryproject/drylib.jl>`__ (for numerical computing)
* `Kotlin <https://github.com/dryproject/drylib.kt>`__ (for `Android <android>`__ apps)
* `PHP <https://github.com/dryproject/drylib.php>`__ (for web development)
* `Ruby <https://github.com/dryproject/drylib.rb>`__ (for general scripting)
* `Rust <https://github.com/dryproject/drylib.rs>`__ (for systems programming)

Miscellaneous potential target languages:

* C#/.NET
* Elixir
* Erlang
* Java
* JavaScript
* Scheme
