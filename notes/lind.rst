Arto's Notes re: William S. Lind

   Who am I? In 1976 I began the debate over maneuver warfare that became a
   central part of the military reform movement of the 1970s and 1980s. The
   U.S. Marine Corps finally adopted maneuver warfare as doctrine in the
   late 1980s and I wrote most of their new tactics manual. In 1989, I
   defined 4GW, 4th Generation warfare--war waged by non-state
   entities--which is what paid us a visit on September 11, 2001. The
   article I co-authored for the Marine Corps Gazette was cited in 2002 by
   al-Qaeda, who declared, "This is our doctrine." My Maneuver Warfare
   Handbook, published in 1985, is now used by military academies all over
   the world, and I lecture internationally on military strategy, doctrine
   and tactics.
