Currently Exploring
===================

Programming languages & environments that I'm currently learning or
exploring:

* ATS
* Coq

* `Common Lisp <common-lisp>`__
* `Lua <lua>`__
* `OCaml <ocaml>`__
* `Ruby <ruby>`__ (1.9 to 2.3)

Previously Mastered
===================

Programming languages that I've mastered but use less frequently, if at all,
these days:

* BASIC (QB)
* `C <c>`__ (C89, C99, C11)
* `Java <java>`__ (1.0 to 8)
* `JavaScript <javascript>`__
* `PHP <php>`__ (3.0 to 5.5)
* `Python <python>`__ (2.0 to 2.7)
* `Ruby <ruby>`__ (1.8 to 2.3)
* `Scheme <scheme>`__ (R4RS, R5RS)
* Visual Basic (1.0 to 6.0)

Previously Used
===============

Programming languages that I've used in the past but don't at present:

* Clojure
* `Forth <forth>`__ (ANS Forth)
* `Groovy <groovy>`__
* `Nim <nim>`__
* Objective-C
* `Rust <rust>`__
* Scala (2.7, 2.8)
* `Wolfram Language <wolfram>`__ (Mathematica)

Academically Interesting
========================

Programming languages that I've previously learned or explored out of
academic interest:

* `Ada/SPARK <ada>`__
* Erlang
* Factor
* Joy
* Mozart/Oz
* `Haskell <haskell>`__
* `Prolog <prolog>`__
* `Smalltalk <smalltalk>`__
* `Standard ML <sml>`__

Deliberately Ignored
====================

Programming languages that I've chosen to deliberately ignore:

* C#
* C++ (C++98, C++03)
* D
* F#
* Fortran
* `Go <go>`__
* Pascal
* Perl
* Scheme (R6RS)
* Swift
* Tcl
