* `Ruby <ruby>`__ (1.8 to 1.9)
* `Scheme <scheme>`__ (R4RS, R5RS)
* Visual Basic (1.0 to 6.0)

Previously Used
===============

Programming languages that I've used in the past but don't at present:

* Clojure
* `Erlang <erlang>`__
* `Forth <forth>`__ (ANS Forth)
* `Go <go>`__
* `Groovy <groovy>`__
* `Nim <nim>`__
* Objective-C
* `Rust <rust>`__
* Scala (2.7, 2.8)
* `Wolfram Language <wolfram>`__ (Mathematica)

Academically Interesting
========================

Programming languages that I've previously learned or explored out of
academic interest:

* `Ada/SPARK <ada>`__
* Factor
* Joy
* Mozart/Oz
* `Haskell <haskell>`__
* `Prolog <prolog>`__
* `Smalltalk <smalltalk>`__
* `Standard ML <sml>`__

Deliberately Ignored
====================

Programming languages that I've chosen to deliberately ignore, for various
reasons:

* C#
* C++ (C++98, C++03)
* D
* F#
* Fortran
* Pascal
* Perl
* Scheme (R6RS)
* Swift
* Tcl
